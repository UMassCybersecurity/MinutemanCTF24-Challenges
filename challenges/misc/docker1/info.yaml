# Flags specify answers that your challenge use. You should generally provide at least one.
flags:
    - content: "UMASS{Ju5t_D0ck3R_8uILd_anD_run_OeLRuxbQ}" # required field for every flag
      type: "static" # must be static or regex
      data: "case_insensitive" # additional data

# Hints are used to give players a way to buy or have suggestions. They are not required but can be nice.
hints:
- content: search up `docker run container from dockerfile`
- content: "The three most popular answers are missing an important point: you need to expose port 80 from the container to the host."
