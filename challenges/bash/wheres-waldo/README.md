# bash-strings challenge

this challenge gives you a cryptic poem and some randomised strings of text. it is meant to teach usage of basic bash commands, but is pretty open ended and can be solved in multiple ways.

ignoring the hint, the strings of text include a bunch of characters, and you are intended to eventually discover that there is one character per line that is only inlcuded once

the intended solution is to, for every line of text, remove any character that is not unique in that line.
