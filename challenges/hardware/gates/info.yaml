  I found this cool circuit that unlocks a mysterious door. Can you help me get the right input so I can open the door?
  Use the flag format 'Minuteman{input_bits}' for example if all 1's where correct then the flag is 'Minuteman{11111111}'.

flags:
  - content: "Minuteman{001010}"

hints:
  - content: This file seems like it can be opened in Logisim Evolution https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution
  - content: See if theres a way to analyze the circuit in Logisim
