description: Sam the minuteman found a letter to Benedict Arnold! We don't know why it's been encrypted, but those unprintable symbols reminds us of a secret document the British leaked recently along with a weird list that had a bunch of 4-letter words. It should still be fine if we just delivered it to him, right? Or do you suppose something is amiss here...?
