# This file represents the base specification of your challenge

# Required sections

description: Variants of Vigen√®re ciphers can be really secure if your keys are long and random. Unfortunately, our challenge is not built like that =((. Brute force all the keys and recover the flag! Each line has a number representing key length followed by the encrypted ciphertext of a random key of that length.

# Flags specify answers that your challenge use. You must provide at least one.
flags:
  - content: "UMASS{we_hold_these_evidences_to_mean_self_true}" # required field for every flag
    type: "static" # must be static or regex
    data: "case_insensitive" # additional data


# Optional settings (defaults defined in default.yaml)

# Name of the challenge
# If not provided it is inferred from folder name
name: Almost Vigenere

# Category of challenge
# If not provided it is inferred from folder name
category: crypto

# Tags are used to provide additional public tagging to a challenge
tags:

# Provide paths to files from the same directory that info.yaml is in (root of challenge)
# Files in the static folder are automatically added and should NOT be defined here
# Note: may not be used

# Hints are used to give players a way to buy or have suggestions. They are not required but can be nice.
hints:
  - content: "The keys are common English words and are ascending in length. The plaintext is also in English, with no symbols."
  - content: "Spaces changes the encryption, what does the encrypt function do diffrently when it encounters a space"
